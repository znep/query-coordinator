// The visualization examples started life as plain HTML files that pulled in static javascript.
// However, this arrangement lives outside of how the rest of the platform manages javascript assets,
// so the examples were pulled into frontend to alleviate maintenance costs.
//
// When we have some time, we should move the javascript that exists as inline <style> tags
// in app/views/demos/visualizations into .js files in this folder. Currently, the inlined
// example javascript cannot be linted or use ES6 features such as imports or arrow functions.
//
// The current purpose of this file is to provide a compatibility shim between our ES6-world
// and the environment the example pages expect.

// Compatibility shim for example page's inability to import packages for itself.
