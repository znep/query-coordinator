# Socrata Frontend

## Starting up

The command to run the HTTP server is:

    sudo nginx -c ${PWD}/dev-server/nginx.conf

The command to run the Rails application server is:

    bundle exec foreman start

Running the Rails stack in development should be done with [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman).
It will spawn a sidecar process running the [webpack dev server](#webpack), which allows for re-bundling 
and automatic reloading on code change. Examine the 
[`Procfile`](https://github.com/socrata/frontend/blob/master/Procfile) to see what processes will be 
started by foreman.

### Development Stack Setup


```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                 browser                                     |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              (*)                 (/javascripts/webpack/*)           |
-------------------------------------------------------------        |
|                          nginx                            |   (websocket)
-------------------------------------------------------------        |
         (port 3000)                  (port 3030)                    |
---------------------------  --------------------------------------------------
| Rails via Unicorn (web) |  |          Webpack Dev Server (webpack)          |
---------------------------  --------------------------------------------------
```

We proxy the webpack dev server through nginx to avoid cross-domain / SSL issues.
The websocket connection is used by the dev server to notify the page of code
changes, where it will either refresh the page, or reload specific assets (CSS,
React components).

The webpack dev server serves its packaged assets from memory. For production
builds, see the [webpack](#webpack) section.

To build a subset of the webpack bundles, use the `FRONTEND_WEBPACK_BUNDLES` environment variable:

    FRONTEND_WEBPACK_BUNDLES=admin,dataset-landing-page bundle exec foreman start

## Running the app _without_ the local stack

Important services are discovered through the 
[`config/config.yml`](https://github.com/socrata/frontend/blob/master/config/config.yml) file.
Below is a brief outline of the minimum required changes to run the frontend locally.

> Note! There is a corresponding file `docker/config.yml.j2` that is a template used to derive 
> the contents of `config/config.yml` within docker containers.

### Core

Under the `development` section of `config.yml`, set the `coreservice_uri` to the appropriate URI for 
the environment you're connecting to. For example, if you want to use the services in the RC environment, 
the URI would be `http://lb-vip.aws-us-west-2-rc.socrata.net:8081`.

### Zookeeper

Under the `development` section of `config.yml`, set the `zk_hosts` to the list of hosts providing 
Zookeeper services. In the RC environment this value is `'10.112.35.120:2181,10.112.36.163:2181,10.112.41.205:2181'`

### Cetera

Under the `development` section of `config.yml`, set the `cetera_host` to the appropriate URI for the 
environment you're connecting to. In the RC environment, this URI is 
`http://cetera.app.marathon.aws-us-west-2-rc.socrata.net`.

For a guide on how to set up Cetera search from Elasticsearch to Frontend, see
[this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wsslEGnp15STX8UnUFZ_kLzxDHkpLWstvAa-9OS31Gk/edit#)

##### Host Spoofing

> Note: This approach is _only_ necessary if you wish to connect to Cetera in a different environment
> but you are _already running_ the other required services locally and _not_ masquerading as a 
> different domain (see Domain below). If you _are_ masquerading as a different domain (i.e. adding an 
> entry to your `/etc/hosts` file), then Cetera will perform catalog searches against that domain, and 
> setting `CETERA_SPOOF_HOST` is redundant.

In order for Cetera to function properly when connecting to other environments such as RC or staging, 
you must also "spoof" the domain that Cetera will search when interacting with the catalog. You must 
set this domain using the `CETERA_SPOOF_HOST` environment variable before starting the frontend. The 
domain you spoof must be a valid domain in the environment you are connecting to. In the RC environment 
one might use `opendata-demo.rc-socrata.com` for example. One way to do this is shown below:

    CETERA_SPOOF_HOST=opendata-demo.rc-socrata.com bundle exec rails s

Or when using `foreman`:

    CETERA_SPOOF_HOST=opendata-demo.rc-socrata.com bundle exec foreman start

### Domain

In order to statisfy Core security checks, you must masquerade as a domain that exists in the 
environment you are connecting to. For example, in RC one might use `opendata-demo.rc-socrata.com`.
In order to masquerade as this domain, one must set your host name to match. One way of doing
this is to add an alias to `/etc/hosts` for your loopback IP address entry. In this example, 
one would change the entry to match:

    127.0.0.1	localhost opendata-demo.rc-socrata.com

### Google Chrome

Finally, in order to satisfy certain security requirements in Google Chrome, you must launch the 
application with an extra argument. This is necessary to resolve Chrome refusing to load "insecure" 
resources. This manifests as failures when loading CSS or Javascript which breaks page rendering.

    open -a Google Chrome --args --disable-web-security

## Dependencies

Dependencies are stored in artifactoryonline.com. A shared username and password can be found in 
LastPass under the user "Socrata-frontend." Instructions on how to use these credentials can be 
found in the "Getting Artifacts" section of the 
[Artifactory Ops Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KihQV3-UBfZEOKIInsQlloESR6NLck8RuP4BUKzX_Y8).

To install dependencies, run:

    bin/setup_environment.sh

This will set up NPM properly and will create a user for `frontend@socrata.com` with password `OpenData!`.

## Tests

tl;dr: First run the Setup steps below, then run:

    bundle exec rake test

This will run all Ruby (MiniTest _and_ RSpec) and Javascript (Karma) tests.

#### To run a specific Ruby test

###### For MiniTest tests

    ruby -I test test/.../file.rb -n /regex_matcher_for_your_test_name/

> Note: The regex match technique does not work for MiniTest tests written using the 
> [MiniTest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) "spec" style.

###### For RSpec tests

    bundle exec rspec spec/.../file.rb:line_number

> Note: The `line_number` is optional can point to a single test, a context, or a describe
> block and all tests within the enclosing scope will be run. If you're updating RSpec tests 
> or writing new ones and you see error messages from VCR complaining about unregistered 
> HTTP requests, you can tell VCR to record the HTTP request(s) in your test by setting the 
> [record mode](https://relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/v/3-0-3/docs/record-modes) to either 
> `:record_mode => :new_episodes` or `:record_mode => :all`.

### Karma tests

We use Karma to test our Javascript code. These tests live under `karma`.
There are multiple test suites defined by files named `karma.conf.js`.

Test suites:

1. Data Lens and Angular common components: `karma/dataCards`
2. Dataset Landing Page: `karma/datasetLandingPage`
3. Old UX tests: `karma/oldUx`

#### Setup

Ensure that you are using Ruby version 2.3.0 or greater.

#### Karma Test Rake Tasks

```sh
bundle exec rake test:js
bundle exec rake test:js:dataCards
bundle exec rake test:js:datasetLandingPage
bundle exec rake test:js:importWizard
bundle exec rake test:js:oldUx
bundle exec rake test:js:adminGoals
```

Each rake task accepts three arguments:

- `watch`: Whether or not to watch files for changes. If a change to any of the tested files is 
detected, the tests will re-run.
> IMPORTANT: If you're using vim, you need to add this to your `.vimrc`:

        set backupcopy=yes

  Otherwise, vim's rename-on-save behavior will confuse webpack. See
  [this issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/781#issuecomment-95523711).
- `browser`: Which browser to run the tests in. Can be `phantom`, `chrome`, or `firefox`.
- `reporter`: Which reporter to use. The default is `dots`. You can also specify
  `mocha`, `progress`, `growl`, and `junit`, or install your own.

Example invocation that watches file changes, runs the dataCards tests in chrome,
and uses the mocha reporter:

    bundle exec rake test:js:dataCards[true,chrome,mocha]

For the simple case where a single test run under PhantomJS is needed for a
general pass/fail check, a faster parallelized test run is also available:

    bundle exec rake test:js:parallel

#### To run a specific Ruby unit test

###### For MiniTest tests

    ruby -I test path/to/file.rb -n /regex_matcher_for_your_test_name/

> Note: The regex match technique does not work for MiniTest tests written using the [MiniTest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) "spec" style.

###### For RSpec tests

    bundle exec rspec path/to/file.rb:line_number

> Note: The line_number can be within a single test, a context, or a describe block and all tests within the enclosing scope will be run.

## Javascript/other asset package management

The frontend has classically used [Jammit](http://documentcloud.github.io/jammit/)
for asset management instead of the standard Rails asset pipeline. All assets
must be added manually to assets.yml, and the appropriate include_javascripts
calls must be included in .erb. If the assets must be loaded on-demand from JS,
make sure the new jammit package is added to the "dump" section of assets.yml
(the JS asset loader reads this section). Please note that though Jammit allows
globs in its package definitions, the JS loader doesn't support globs. This is
only an issue for on-demand loading.

### Webpack

Assets for data lens, dataset landing page, and some old UX pages are packaged
using [webpack](http://webpack.io).

Webpack provides ES2015 w/ JSX transpilation through [Babel](http://babeljs.io),
source map generation, hot module reloading for Babel, angular module annotation
and template in-lining, uglification, and other modern front-end developer niceties.
Its configuration is located in `config/webpack`. Each file ending in `.config.js`
represents a configuration for a javascript module in the project.

For production, webpack can generate bundles with a fingerprint hash in their
filenames, as well as a manifest file mapping the entry name to its hashed
name. The Rails initializer in `config/initializers/webpack.rb` holds configuration
for this, and the `include_webpack_bundle` helper in `application_helper.rb` allows
for seamless inclusion of webpack bundles during development and in production.

One-time webpack bundle generation can be done with:

    bundle exec rake assets:webpack

The rake command above runs `npm run build:prod` which generates the production assets
that will be used by the frontend when running in production. You can test the assets
generated by this process by starting the frontend with the following environment
variables set, which simulates running webpack in production:

    WEBPACK_USE_MANIFEST=true WEBPACK_USE_DEV_SERVER=false rails s

Running the Rails stack with [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) will
spawn a sidecar process running the webpack dev server, which allows for re-bundling
and automatic reloading on code change. IMPORTANT: If you're using vim, you need to
add this to your `.vimrc`:

    set backupcopy=yes

Otherwise, vim's rename-on-save behavior will confuse webpack. See
[this issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/781#issuecomment-95523711).

To enable the workflow:

    bundle install
    bundle exec foreman start

#### Webpack Loaders

- `babel-loader` for ES2015 and JSX transpilation
- `eslint-loader` for linting and reporting issues to the browser
- `react-hot-loader` for reloading React components in place without a page
  reload, preserving their state
- `ng-annotate-loader` for converting the function syntax of angular's dependency
  injection into something that can be uglified
- `ngtemplate-loader` for allowing `require`ing angular templates and priming the
  template cache

### JSCodeShift

[jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) is a tool for doing AST-to-AST transformations of JS code. 
It is helpful for making changes across a codebase that are more complicated than just a search and replace.

Under the `tools/jscodeshift-transforms` are a few transformations for modifying our code in an AST-to-AST manner.

To run a transform, follow the instructions on the jscodeshift project page, but setting and environment variable 
of `BABEL_ENV=jscodeshift` — this ensures that a clean babel configuration is used for the transforms, alleviating 
an issue with babel versions.

## Tools in `bin` directory

These tools can be used to run commands like `rails`, `rake`, `bundler` and so on, when on the application is 
deployed in a development environment.

An example of starting up the `rails` console on a production host is:

    sudo -u blist RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec bin/rails c

An example of running `bundler` on a prouction host:

    sudo -u blist RAILS_ENV=production bundle install --without=development --deployment

An example of running `rake` on a production host:

    sudo -u blist RAILS_ENV=productionbundle exec bin/rake routes

You can add `-h` for more options. By default it routes requests to `dataspace-demo.test-socrata.com`. 
That may change in the future.

## Linting

A linter is a tool that we use to find problematic patterns or code that doesn't
adhere to certain style guidelines. For javascript, we use `eslint`, because it's
highly configurable. `eslint` is automatically installed via npm as a dev dependency.
For ruby, we use `reek`, which is installed as a gem.

Although the codebase is automatically linted by Jenkins for each build, you can manually
run linters for different parts of the codebase using the following
rake tasks:

```sh
rake lint:js:all       # Lint the whole javascript codebase
rake lint:js:oldUx     # Lint the old ux
rake lint:js:dataCards # Lint data lens
rake lint:js:datasetLandingPage # Lint dataset landing page
rake lint:js:diff      # Lint javascript files changed on this branch
rake lint:ruby         # Lint ruby code
rake lint              # Lint all the things
```

The lint tasks take an optional argument representing the desired format of the output.
The default for the `js` flavors is 'stylish' and the default for the `ruby` flavors is
'text'. See the [eslint documentation](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#f-format) and the
[reek documentation](https://github.com/troessner/reek#output-formats) for more formats. Example:

    rake lint:js:all[junit]

If you're too cool for rake tasks, you can also run `npm run eslint -- [args]`
or `bundle exec reek [args]` on the command line and supply your own arguments.
You can find our specific configuration options for `eslint` in `package.json`
under the `eslintConfig` key. Currently we use no configuration options for
`reek`.

## Configuration variables

Below is the list of known environment variables that are used by the frontend. In most cases these are used to define values used by the Rails application itself, but in some other cases, they are used to provide information to third party services and APIs.

Most, but not all, of the variables defined below are specified as, or can optionally be overridden by ENV variables, but in a
small number of cases, the values are hard-coded in `config/config.yml`. In the remainder, the values are specified in `apps-marathon/resources/frontend.json` with selected overrides for different environments specified in `params/*/frontend.toml` where `*` may be one of `eu-west-1-prod`, `fedramp-prod`, `infrastucture`, `local`, `rc`, or `staging`. The values specified in the `apps-marathon` configuration files are injected into `config/config.yml` by way of the `docker/config.yml.j2` template file. Other values are simply set as ENV variables.

> Note! Any changes made to `config/config.yml` to add new configuration directives must also be matched by requisite changes to `docker/config.yml.j2` accordingly.

In the case where the configuration variable is being provided as an ENV variable, the variable name is referenced in ALL CAPS, so `airbrake_environnment_name` would be written as `AIRBRAKE_ENVIRONNMENT_NAME`, but when referenced at runtime within the code, it is most often converted to a variable that is all lowercase. In certain special cases, headers such as `x-socrata-auth` are written in lowercase in the header itself, so be thorough when seaching for usages of any of these variables.
