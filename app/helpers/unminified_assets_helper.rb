# Jammit does not provide the option to selectively minify assets.
# This poses a problem to Angular apps, as function param names
# can be significant to the injector. This module provides a way to
# include the unminified code packages. Note that for this to work
# correctly in production mode, the unminified packages must have
# been built by running rake assets:unminified. These packages
# live in #{Jammit.package_path/unminified/}
