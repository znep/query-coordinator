# This object takes parameters that identify a draft story and attempt to publish the story.
# Publishing the story creates a PublishedStory record in the database and calls the core
# service to update the story permissions and set them to public.
#
# After calling `publish`, the story attribute will contain the PublishedStory object
# that was created. It will have validation errors if the story could not be saved.
#
# If the permissions update fails, the story will be null, and an airbrake exception will be raised.

    # creates a new PublishedStory. Therefore, for the time being, we must

    # it is the latest draft. (EN-19563, EN-21838)
