    <p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited to announce the introduction of Auth0 for the Socrata login experience. Auth0 provides a simpler login process, and creates the foundation to easily enable </span><a href="https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/214892617-Using-single-sign-on-SSO-with-Socrata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single Sign On (SSO)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Two Factor Auth for Open Data, Open Performance, and Perspectives.</span></strong></p>
    <p><img class="wysiwyg-text-align-center" src="https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/210794088/Screen_Shot_2016-08-19_at_2.14.48_PM.png" alt="" width="375" height="366" /></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the change to Auth0, the look-and-feel of the login box on all Socrata Open Data and Open Performance sites will receive the new design you see above. Other than a new design there are no changes to how you login, so you can continue to sign into your Socrata domain(s) the same way you always have. You will see this new design on your site within the next month.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By upgrading to Auth0, it is even easier to </span><a href="https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/214892617-Using-single-sign-on-SSO-with-Socrata"><span style="font-weight: 400;">connect with your Single Sign On (SSO) provider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are interested in learning more about how to enable SSO on your Socrata site, reach out to your Customer Success Manager or support@socrata.com.</span></p>

  title: 'Announcement: Changes to the Upcoming August 20th Maintenance Window [Updated
    Aug 1]'
  body: |-
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Socrata we hold standard maintenance windows on the third Saturday of every month in order to perform critical updates to the platform. For the maintenance window currently scheduled for Saturday, August 20th, 2016, we will be </span><strong>moving the window to Friday, August 19th, 2016, and expanding the time to 3-7pm PDT (10pm-2am UTC)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we understand this time window may occur during your business hours, we analyzed usage patterns across the Socrata platform and determined that Friday afternoons in August have lower traffic than Saturdays, and as such we’ve chosen this time to minimize disruption to end-users. This expanded maintenance window will allow us to move our platform to Amazon Web Services, a more secure, reliable, and scalable cloud environment, and continue to provide the best possible service on the platform.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately before, during, and after the maintenance window, we will communicate updates via our status site (</span><a href="http://status.socrata.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">status.socrata.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). If you have any questions about Socrata’s maintenance window policy, please read </span><a href="https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/202951578-What-is-Socrata-s-maintenance-window-policy-"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this support article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any further questions and/or concerns about this change, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at </span><a href="mailto:support@socrata.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@socrata.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>UPDATE</strong>: After the maintenance window on August 19th, the IP addresses for a majority of Socrata domains will change. Tools or systems that are configured to the current IP addresses will need to be adjusted. For example, you may have network firewall rules that allow traffic to certain IP addresses. If you believe you may be affected, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@socrata.com">support@socrata.com</a> to get the new IP addresses.</span></p>
