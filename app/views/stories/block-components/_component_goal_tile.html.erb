Component format:
{
 type: "goal.tile",
 value: {
   domain: <goal domain>,
   goalUid: <goal four-by-four>,
   goalFullUrl: <goal URL as pasted in by user>
                (this includes, e.g. the dashboard 4x4 which we otherwise
                have no way of knowing)
 }
}
Blank because all DOM is generated in JS (componentGoalTile).
