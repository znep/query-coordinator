# WARNING: This is NOT a comprehensive list. Because of the nature of the config
# system, it is possible to create a new 'type' simply by choosing a different string
# when coding it.
#
# Meaningful Properties (they do not show up in autocomplete):
# * `discourage_in_creation_ui`
#   When you add an `instead`, prefer using the named route, such as :feature_flags_config
# * `default_config_name`
#   When creating a config, this will be the default.
# Everything else just gets dumped out for the user to see.
#
# `known_properties` is mostly to make sure it's easy for the autocomplete to match something.
