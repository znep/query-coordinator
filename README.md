## Contributing

All contributions must go through a review process. We use GitHub pull requests for this and assign
reviewers via a Snu command via Slack: `snu cr frontend <link to your PR>`. There are team-specific
review groups - ask your team if those are preferred for the work you are doing.

Please see the [steps](https://github.com/socrata/platform-ui/tree/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)
steps which are auto-populated into new pull requests before merging.
