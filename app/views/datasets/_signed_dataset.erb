     Using a <strong>digitally signed dataset</strong>, it is possible to
     prove using cryptographically secure methods that a particular copy
     of a Socrata dataset has not been tampered with. This is useful if,
     for instance, you are looking to publish findings based on this data,
     and you want to be able to prove its integrity.</p>

     To obtain a signed version of this dataset, simply click on the
     link below to generate a key and begin the download. The key and
     downloaded data are specific to the current version of this dataset;
     if the owner updates the dataset in the future, you will have to
     restart the process to get the new data. Publish the downloaded data
     along with the key that you receive, and using the instructions found
     within the downloaded package, third parties will be able to confirm
     that your data is legitimate.</p>

     To generate a signed version of this dataset, simply click on the
     link below to generate a key. Note that if you update this dataset in
     the future, you will have to return and regenerate the key in order
     for consumers to again have access to it. Also note that this process
     involves operations on the entirety of the data, so it may take some
     time if your dataset is very large, or contains large attachments.</p>
