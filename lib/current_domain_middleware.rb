# Set the current domain on every request
# We used to do this as a before_filter, but that didn't work as reliably as
# we wanted to - in particular, rendering errors (404 in particular) would
# pick a theme at "random" because we never got to the point of running a
# controller - so the before_filter hook didn't run, and we used whatever
# domain the app server last ran. By using a rack middleware to set the
# CurrentDomain instead, we guarantee it's set regardless of whether it's
# an error or not.
#
# FIXME: The code in CurrentDomain is pretty ugly with the use of class-
# scoped variables. The bug where a domain could still leak between requests
# still exists in some form; in reality the cache of domains should survive
# across requests but the code that uses CurrentDomain.____ accessors should
# be converted to use the rack env['socrata.current_domain'] variable instead.
