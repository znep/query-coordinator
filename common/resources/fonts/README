# Socrata Fonts (really just socrata-icons).

The `socrata-icons` font is generated here. Since this font is rarely changed, the
build artifacts are checked in and referenced directly. If you need to update the
font, see below.

## Using socrata-icons

Pull in both SCSS files at common/resources/fonts/dist/

## Updating socrata-icons

The fonts are generated via Gulp. With your UX designer, make the requisite changes to the source SVG.
Then run:
```sh
cd common/resources/fonts && npm i && npm run build
```
Check in the changes to the files. You're done.
