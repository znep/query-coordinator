# Socrata's Styleguide Documentation Sample App

!! NOTE: This is a temporary home for this project - it will be moved into frontend soon !!

## Goals :sparkles:
- Provide a canonical example of how to create a page. *Note* this is work-in-progress. Do not
  consider current practices in this app as standard. In particular, gulp and middleman are _not_
  recommended for any future development.
- Provide a place to construct an experiment with styles destined for the Socrata Platform.
- Make it possible to quickly prototype a design using styles and design patterns.
- Collaborate on UI components and patterns, and share them across projects.
- Promote the use of React components in downstream projects.

For information about the motivations around the philosophy of the Styleguide please read the [Frontend Components proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iozeArAm1QMDzZxMSmkBlJzyczGOQhV6MBfiNLbXpQ0).

## Prototyping - `docs/prototypes`
Prototypes are fully-featured layouts used to inform product decisions and serve as a template for developers.
Stylesheets for prototypes are located in `docs/stylesheets/prototypes`.
