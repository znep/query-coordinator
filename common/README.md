# Socrata Platform Common Code

*IMPORTANT: Currently, frontend does not import common code directly. It pulls it in from the package
generated by packages/socrata-utils. This is a temporary situation while we finish the monorepo work.*

## Terminology

* Module: Unit of shared code in the `common` directory. Must live in its own subdirectory of `common`.

## Organization

The `common` directory contains code modules that are shared between at least two services in this repo.
Each directory within `common` defines a reusable code module in either Ruby, JavaScript, CSS, or HTML.

## Module Requirements

*Note: This section will evolve as these structures are relatively young.*
*Note: Be responsible when changing these requirements. If your proposed change involves
making existing modules non-compliant, seriously consider your obligation to update
those existing modules.*

All modules, regardless of technology used, must satisfy these conditions:

0. Have a clear reason for being shared.
1. Have a clear name. For instance, `FeatureFlags`.
2. Define their implementation in `common/${MODULE_NAME}`.
3. Have a README.md in their folder.
4. Run a suite of tests when the `test` task is invoked from the shared Rakefile (`common/Rakefile`).
5. Run a linter when the `lint` task is invoked from the shared Rakefile (`common/Rakefile`).

## Contributing

When contributing a new module or modifying an existing one, please ensure your pull request
achieves the following:

1. Global checks pass (`rake test && rake lint` from the root of the repo).
2. Passes a design review with a senior-level or above engineer, if the change:
  1. Adds or removes a module.
  2. Adds, changes, or removes module API.
  3. Imports a new external library.
3. All usages of modified modules are updated to reflect the change, if applicable.
4. A demo is given of the changes in all relevant projects.

It is suggested that you consider these requirements _before_ you begin changing code. A series of small,
incremental changes is often preferable and faster to implement than a large, monolithic change that must
be merged all at once.
