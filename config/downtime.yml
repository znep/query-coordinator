# PLEASE SEE THE metachef REPO AND EDIT THE APPROPRIATE json FILE IN THE environments DIRECTORY
#
# message_start and message_end determine when to display the notification.
# downtime_start and downtime_end determine the actual time of the downtime.
# by convention we display messaging 48 hours in advance of the downtime and
# turn off the messaging at the conclusion of the downtime.
#
# Example:
#
# production:
#     message_start:  2014-01-23t17:00-08:00
#     message_end:    2014-01-25t21:00:00-08:00
#     downtime_start: 2014-01-25t17:00:00-08:00
#     downtime_end:   2014-01-25t21:00:00-08:00
