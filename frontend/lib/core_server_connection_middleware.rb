# This is similar to CurrentDomainMiddleware. We need to hook in as early
# as possible so we can give the core server connection the environment
# so it can pass along headers (such as user agent).
# Tried to do this as a before_filter, but that didn't work as reliably as
# we wanted to - in particular, current domain (from the middleware) loads the
# current domain long before it gets to controllers.
