      # This addresses a sharp corner whereby the id of the underlying catalog_query record can change when
      # The update contains only a single featured content item, which causes a deletion of that record, which
      # leads to the deletion of the orphaned catalog_query record. Then the featured content item is saved,
      # which leads to the creation of a new catalog_query record, which leads to state getting out of sync
      # between frontend w/r/t the catalog_query record primary key. This is discussed in the following doc:
