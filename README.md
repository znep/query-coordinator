# README

## Setup

### Requirements
* Ruby 2.2.3
* Postgresql 9.3+

### System dependencies

```
brew update
```

Install postgres:

```
brew install postgres
```

Install rbenv and ruby:

```
brew install rbenv ruby-build
rbenv install 2.2.3
```

To run unit tests, install node and npm: https://nodejs.org/download/,
then install npm dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Configuration

#### Set up the database

Run `bin/setup` from within the storyteller root. This will install
dependencies and create and install the database and migrations. It will also
create a good starting `database.yml` for development and test.

#### AWS setup for S3

In order to be able to upload images in development mode, some AWS credentials need
to be pulled from lastpass. The lastpass login is called "Storyteller Upload IAM"
and lives in the "Shared-Socrata Engineering Common" folder. The values in this
secure note should be added to `.env` in the rails root.

There is a script to do this for you (requires the [lastpass-cli](https://github.com/LastPass/lastpass-cli) to be
installed):
```
bin/setup_s3
```

#### Multisite Setup

On your local development instance, you'll likely want to have a nice multi-site
setup. run `bin/setup_multisite` to setup pow and have it so that you can reach
your local storyteller instance with blah.dev, vertex.dev, etc.

## Run Server

To run the rails server:
```
bin/start
```

We also have a delayed job queue for processing uploaded files. Everything but uploading files
will work without this. The jobs can be processed manually with a rake task:
```
bin/rake jobs:work
```

Alternatively, you can run both processes in the same terminal window with foreman.Ã‚
```
bundle exec forman start
```

## How to run the test suite

### Setting up the test environment

`bin/test_setup`

### tl;dr: All tests

`bin/rake test`

Coverage results are in ```coverage/```

### Ruby tests

`bin/rake spec`

To run just one rspec test: `bundle exec rspec <path-to-file>`

### Javascript tests

We use Karma to test our Javascript.

Run all Karma tests locally in PhantomJS:
`bin/rake karma`

Same, but watch for changes (while developing):
`bin/rake karma:watch`

## Code coverage
The ```spec``` and ```karma``` tasks generate code coverage reports. They can be found here:

* Ruby: ```coverage/ruby/index.html```
* JS: ```coverage/<browser name>/index.html```

## Services

As we add services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.), document them here.

## Deployment

Deployment is done via marathon to AWS. Staging deployment is continuous from
the master branch.

See [Storyteller AWS Setup Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZTsUNw3JxbQozdjq69NdnOD1dLYMpzDfQsoolGV-Wb8/edit#heading=h.w14ab4sv58p0) for deploying to a brand new environment.

If a deployment has any migrations that need to be run, they must be run
manually against the production databases. See below for example commands.

Migrations are not run as part of the automatic deployment scripts because
they are high risk, need to be supervised, and typically are run once.

There is a task for checking whether migrations need to be run. See `rake aws:migrate:status` below.

### Deploy to RC, Prod, FedRAMP, EU

See the [Storyteller OpsDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZTsUNw3JxbQozdjq69NdnOD1dLYMpzDfQsoolGV-Wb8/edit#heading=h.dgeqv4t1n2bi) for deployment instructions.

In order to deploy to the `fedramp-prod` environment, you need to get FedRAMP VPN setup and be able to [access bastions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BNjUz3Q_DU2q1iDLeY5vk84GwXBDGj5vQQJdeBXpQ-Y/edit#) (jump boxes).

See [Storyteller OpsDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZTsUNw3JxbQozdjq69NdnOD1dLYMpzDfQsoolGV-Wb8/edit#heading=h.l0gnqlmtrqxj) for additional FedRAMP deployment instructions.

### Migrations

Running rails database migrations against our production RDS
instances in AWS can be done with a handful of rake tasks.

```
$ bin/rake -T aws
rake aws:migrate[region,environment]   # Migrate database in AWS
rake aws:rollback[region,environment]  # Rollback database in AWS
rake aws:seed[region,environment]      # Seed database in AWS
rake aws:migrate:status[region,environment]  # Check database migration status in AWS
```

Before running the migration rake tasks, ensure you have AWS admin access to staging/rc
and that you're connected to the VPN. You must also have the `aws_migrations` key in
your `database.yml` file, which can be found in `database.yml.sample`.

AWS admin credentials must be set up by an OPS team member.

To perform migrations against `staging` or `rc` in the `us-west-2` region:

```
bin/rake aws:migrate[us-west-2,staging]
bin/rake aws:migrate[us-west-2,rc]
```

Additionally, `rollback` and `seed` are supported.

```
bin/rake aws:rollback[us-west-2,staging]
bin/rake aws:seed[us-west-2,staging]
```

And migrating a different region might look like this:

```
bin/rake aws:migrate[eu-west-1,staging]
```

## Profiling

The `rack_mini_profiler` and `flamegraph` gems have been installed and are automatically
loaded in development mode.

The profiler tool adds a widget to the top left that profiles rendering and database calls.

To view the flamegraph for a page, append `?pp=flamegraph` to any url.

## Linting

The following command will run `eslint` on the javascript codebase:

```
npm run lint [-- eslint_options]
```

The configuration options for `eslint` can be found in `package.json`. A rake task will also
lint the javascript codebase:

```
rake lint:js
```

## Dependencies

Ruby dependencies are via bundler.
Javascript dependencies are via bower.

### Updating frontend-visualizations and/or frontend-utils

This is weird at the moment because neither of these packages are version-tagged. For now there are two hack scripts that force bower to re-pull from the respective packages' master branch:


```
bin/update_socrata_visualizations.sh
bin/update_socrata_utils.sh
```
